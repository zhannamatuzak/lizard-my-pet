# Lizard Is My Pet

## Introduction & Project's Goal

This Django project functions as a specialized blog designed for individuals contemplating the idea of adopting a ü¶é lizard as a pet. It caters not only to those in search of essential information for decision-making but also to experienced lizard owners eager to share their firsthand experiences. Owners are invited to share insights into various aspects of daily life with their lizard, including preferred food choices, potential size and growth, lifespan, and even unique names for these captivating pets. The administrator provides visitors with posts about various lizard species, offering a comprehensive overview to assist them in making informed decisions. Simultaneously, visitors who have a lizard as a pet can actively contribute by sharing their own experiences in the experience (comments) section below each post. Reading about the experiences of others serves as a valuable resource for decision-making too. Only registered users have access to submit their experiences across all posts and to like the posts.

### Agile Strategy

This project follows the agile approach, encompassing the entire development lifecycle from initial planning to final implementation. To illustrate the process, I established a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/zhannamatuzak/projects/1) and employed the Kanban board method provided. This method facilitated the breakdown of project elements into user stories and manageable tasks.

Ensuring the successful implementation of user stories is fundamental to this project. It involves testing to confirm that the delivered features align with specified criteria.

To access comprehensive details, including acceptance criteria and tasks for each user story, please refer to the linked project above. Additionally, each story is categorized with a labeled indicator, signifying its importance to the overall functionality and acceptability of the site. The user stories are closely aligned with their respective epics (Full User Managment, Manage posts, Create, Editing and Deleting Experiences), and three epics are organized under the milestone "Create the full Backend and Frontend". For a detailed view of user stories, please refer to the ['Testing.md'](https://github.com/zhannamatuzak/lizard-my-pet/blob/main/TESTING.md) document."

### Scope

The scope of this project encompasses a set of features designed to create an engaging and interactive blog centered around lizards (posts).

- Admin created lizards (posts) with full CRUD functionality from the backend;
- Lizards (posts) List and Detailed Lizard webpages;
- User account creation;
- User shared experiences (comments) with full front-end CRUD functionality;
- User likes with full front-end CRUD functionality;
- Identify and show seit user mumber of shared experiences (comments) per Lizard (post).

## Design Choices

### Colors

- The colourful color palette was used as a topic is about lizards. 
- The headings, icons and body text are darker to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user across the site.
- The pink header and footer ensures clear contrast and delineation between sections.
- The background color of the main is light blue.
- The area with the text is almost on the white background.

I used this palette to style the blog:

### Typography

- The font combination I have seen on the website of one CI student. I liked it and implemented it in my project.
- The headings use Amatic SC with a fallback of cursive and the body text uses Roboto Condensed with a fallback of san-serif.

### Icons

- The icons on the paginated post list provide a clear understanding of each section on the post.

![icons post list](documentation/icons_list.png)

- The familiar Edit and Delete icons were utilized beneath shared experiences (comments) for user convenience.

![edit and delete buttons](documentation/icons.png)

### Animations: links & buttons

- The navbar, social icons (white) and buttons across the site have effects when hovered over by the user.

![buttons](documentation/buttons.png)

- All links have a dark brown color and change the color to light brown when hovered for clear distinction from the body text.

### Responsiveness
- The website was designed mobile-first using flexbox to ensure responsiveness throughout the website.
- The standard grid from Bootstrap was used to achieve this.

### Wireframes

The initial wireframes in [canva](https://www.canva.com/) are an overly simplified version of the finished product and merely served the purpose of listing most of the site's essential features.

#### Home Page

![home page wireframe](documentation/home_page_wireframe.png)

#### Detailed view of a Post

![detailed view of the post](documentation/detailed_view_wireframe.png)

## Database Design

The Database consists of three models:

* **USER:** where all data of each registered user is stored.

* **LIZARD:** where all data of each post is stored.

* **EXPERIENCE:** where all data of each written experience (comment) is stored.

The database model diagram was designed using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

![Data model](documentation/data_model.png)

**USER MODEL**

In this project, Django's built-in application, contrib.auth, was utilized to manage user authentication and authorization. This application provides a comprehensive infrastructure encompassing models, views, and forms. Its functionalities extend to handling user authentication, password reset mechanisms, permissions, and more.

![User model](documentation/user_model.png)

**Custom Models:**

**ü¶éLIZARD MODEL**

The Lizard model was customised according to the data needed for the "Lizard is my pet" blog concept.

| key          | Database Key   | Type             | Validation   |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
|              | title          | CharField        | max_length=100, unique=True |           
|              | slug           | SlugField        | max_length=100, unique=True |
|   FK         | author         | User model       | User, on_delete=models.CASCADE |
|              | description    | TextField        | validators=[RegexValidator(regex=r'^[A-Za-z0-9\s\.,!?]*$')] |
|              | image          | CloudinaryField  | default='default' |
|              | created_on     | DateField        | uto_now_add=True |
|              | max_size       | IntegerField     | validators=[MinValueValidator(1)] |
|              | lifespan       | IntegerField     | validators=[MinValueValidator(1)] |
|              | price_from     | IntegerField     | validators=[MinValueValidator(1)] |
|              | price_to       | User Model       | validators=[MinValueValidator(1)] |
|              | diet           | CharField        | max_length=50, choices=DIET, default="0" |
|              | diet_list      | TextField        | validators=[RegexValidator(regex=r'^[A-Za-z0-9\s\.,!?]*$')] |
|              | status         | IntegerField     | choices=STATUS, default=0 |

‚ùó I had to change the "diet" variable field from Integer to CharField.

#### Installing libraries

- Install **Gunicorn** (server used to run Django on Heroku):

```
pip3 install django gunicorn
```

- Install **pyscopg2** (connects to PostgreSQL): 

```
pip 3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2
```

- Install **Cloudinary** (host static files and images):

```
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
```

- Install **Whitenoise** (prevent issues with Heroku not rendering custom stylesheet): 

```
pip3 install whitenoise
```

#### Getting set up

- Create **requirements.txt file** (keeps track of the modules and packages used in your projects): 

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

- Create **new Django project**: 

```
django-admin startproject lizardmypet .
```

- Create **blog app** (name of the repo will be "blog"): 

```
python3 manage.py startapp blog
```

- Create **add blog app to installed apps** (the blog app needs to be added to the list of installed apps in the settings.py)
- Migrate **changes to the database** (when there is a new app, migrations are automatically created): 

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

- Run **project** (It will show the error states your specific host. Copy and paste it into the settings.py file ALLOWED_HOSTS.): 

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

If everything works, it will appear this:

![Django: The install worked successfully!](documentation/django_setup.png)

#### Creating the Heroku App

- Log into Heroku and go to the Dashboard;
- In your new app‚Äôs settings tab, ensure the Config Var DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC key has a value of 1.
- Click **New** and select **Create new app** from the drop-down;
- Name app appropriately and choose relevant region, then click **Create App**;
- Connect your repository to Heroku;
- Deploy the app to Heroku by clicking "Deploy Branch" button. If you want to enable auto-deployment, click "Enable Automatic Deployment";

![Heroku: Automatic Deployment](documentation/heroku_deploy.png)

- Install the webserver gunicorn and add it to the project requirements:

```
pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
```

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

- Create a Procfile at the root directory of the project, declare the process as web and add a start command:

```
web: gunicorn codestar.wsgi
```

**Hint:** Note there is a space after the colon.
**Hint:** The Procfile has no file extension.

#### Create PostgreSQL database using ElephantSQL

This is necessary to create a database that can be accessed by Heroku. The database provided by Django can not be accessed by the deployed Heroku app.

- Log into ElephantSQL and go to Dashboard;
- Click **Create New Instance**

![New Instance ElephantSQL](documentation/new-instance-sql.png)

- Set up a plan by providing a Name (project name) and select a Plan (for this project the free plan "Tiny Turtle" was chosen). Tags are optional;

![Plan and Name ElephantSQL](documentation/name-plan-sql.png)

- Click **Select Region** and choose appropriate Data center;

![Select region and data center](documentation/datacenter_sql.png)

- Click **Review**, check all details and click **Create Instance**;
- Return to Dashboard on click on the name of the newly created instance;
- Copy the database URL from the details section.

![Details section](documentation/details_sql.png)

- Create a superuser for your database:

```
 python manage.py createsuperuser
 ```

#### Hiding sensitive information

- Create ``env.py`` file and ensure it is included in the ``.gitignore`` file
- Add ``import os`` to env.py file and set environment variable **DATABASE_URL** to the URL copied from ElephantSQL:

```
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"
```

- Below, set **SECRET_KEY** variable:

```
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="mysecretkey"
```

Hier I have generated the key: [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)

#### Update Settings

- Add the following code at the top of ``settings.py`` to connect Django project to env.py:
    ````
      import os
      import dj_database_url
      if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
          import env
    ````
- Remove insecure secret key provide by Django in settings.py and refer to variable in env.py instead:

```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```

- To connect to new database, replace provided **DATABASE** variable with 
    ````
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
    ````
- Change the value of DEBUG back to True as this will ensure that you get detailed errors to ease debugging during development.
- Save and migrate all changes made.
`python3 manage.py migrate``

#### Connecting Heroku to Database

- In Heroku dashboard, go to **Settings** tab;
- Add three new config vars **DATABASE_URL** (value is database URL), **SECRET_KEY** (value is secret key string) and **PORT** (value "8000").

#### Connect to Cloudinary

- In Cloudinary dashboard, copy **API Environment variable**

![Cloudinary API](documentation/cloudinary_api.png)

- In ``env.py`` file, add new variable ``os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "<copied_variable"`` and remove ``CLOUDINARY_URL=`` from the variable string
- Add same variable value as new Heroku config var named **CLOUDINARY_URL**
- In ``settings.py``, in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list, above ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` add ``cloudinary_storage``, below add ``cloudinary``
- To define Cloudinary as static file storage add the following to settings.py
    ````
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ````

#### Allow Heroku as host

- In ``settings.py`` add
    ````
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ````
If everything works successfully during the deployment process, it will look like this:

![No error Heroku](documentation/no-error-heroku.png)

#### Final Deployment

- Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
- Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

##### ‚ùó Fixed Bugs

- Problem 1:  When renaming the my Django project, I have manually changed the project folder's name only.

  - *Solution 1: Renaming a Django project typically involves manually changing the project folder's name, but it also requires updating references to the old project name in various files within the project. Here's a summary of the steps involved:*
    - Rename the Project Directory;
    - Rename the root directory of your Django project to the new project name;
    - Update manage.py and wsgi.py Files;
    - Inside the project directory, there are files named manage.py and wsgi.py. Update these files to use the new project name.
    - Update the settings.py File;
    - Open the settings.py file inside your project folder and change the ROOT_URLCONF to point to the new project name.
    - Update database tables to reflect the new project name. You can do this using Django migrations.
    ``python manage.py makemigrations``
    ``python manage.py migrate``
    - Update the ASGI_APPLICATION (if applicable);
    - Update ASGI_APPLICATION setting to use the new project name.
    - Update wsgi.py:
        - Open the wsgi.py file in the root of your project folder.
        - Inside wsgi.py, find the line that looks like this:

        ```
        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'oldproject.settings')
        ```

        - Update the project name to the new name:

        ```
        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'newproject.settings')
        ```

- Problem 2: By deploying the project to Heroku I have got H10-App Crashed Error.
  - *Solution 2: I found the answer to this problem from [Igor Basuga](https://github.com/bravoalpha79) on slack.
  So, I checked, as Igor recommend, if Requirements.txt file is not updated, if Typo is in Procfile, or if one or more of the required Heroku Config Vars missing. These three possible issues I have not had. 
  Finally, I checked other files and found out that when changing the project name, my changes to wsgi.py file were not saved.*
