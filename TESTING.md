## Validation Testing

### [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 
As this is a Django project, the HTML couldn't be tested via the site's URL, due to Django tags and Jinja templating language in HTML files. Instead, the source code of each page was pasted into the validator directly.

| Page | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Home Page](documentation/index.png) | Pass |
| [Lizard Detail](documentation/detail.png) | Pass |
| [Edit Experience](documentation) | Pass |
| [Delete Experience](documentation/edit.png) | Pass |
| [Sign up](documentation/signup.png) | Pass |
| [Login](documentation/login.png) | Pass |
| [Logout](documentation/logout.png) | Pass |
| [Error 404](documentation/error.png) | Pass |

Problems:
- Forms code provided by Django Quill failed HTML W3C Validation for having a for attribute referencing a hidden input type: this is a common issue, that should be noted within the README but it is not necessary to take action over (sourse: [Alfred](https://github.com/AlfredA93/recipe-repo-2/blob/main/TESTING.md), cohort student with whome we had weekly meetups.);
- summernote;

### CSS

[Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS.

![css validation](documentation/css_validator.png)

Error: When changeing DEBUG to False, the style was not applied.
Solution: I have not collect static files locally to collect static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory.
So, I collect:

```

python manage.py collectstatic

```

### Python

[Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python.

| File | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **STEAMAND LEAF** |
| [lizardmypet/urls.py](documentation/url.png) | Pass |  
| **BLOG** |
| [blog/views.py](documentation/views_blog.png) | minor issues: 60: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
100: E303 too many blank lines (2), 135: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters) | 
| [blog/models.py](documentation/models.png) | minor issues: 32: E501 line too long (130 > 79 characters),
51: E501 line too long (130 > 79 characters), 105: E501 line too long (102 > 79 characters) |
